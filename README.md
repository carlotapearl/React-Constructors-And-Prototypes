# React-Constructors-And-Prototypes
The Iron Yard Week 9.1: Pair Programming Activity

First activity for React Language Focus. The Iron Yard Week 9.

## Activity: Character Creator - Pair Programming
Work with your peers to create valid constructors and prototypes given the guidelines of the assignment in the provided JavaScript file.

## Steps  
During this activity:
Read each set of instructions carefully and create code in the provided spots.
Discuss each step of creating a constructor and linking its properties in the prototypal chain.
Run the index.html file in your browser and check your console by creating the given console.log statements to see if you are on track.
Continue editing until you have answered all of the questions.
Stop frequently to discuss what is going on.

## Getting Started  

This activity includes starter files: an index.html file and a constructors.js file. The index.html file is already linked to your JavaScript file and just needs to be run in the browser and refreshed after each change.

## Your role as a student
Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
